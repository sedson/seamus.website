I'm Seamus (b. 1995), and this is my website: a place to organize my work and thoughts across programming, design, and art. ~ May 2024. ~

## @mt-1 Currently 
I'm creating tools to make things (sounds, images, games, comics) using the web browser. Right now these tools are suited to my own tastes and curiosities, but I am hoping to share them with friends very soon. For the last year I've been working on [Gum-/projects/gum] — a mini 3d engine using JavsScript + WebGL and [SynthKit-/projects/synthkit] — a WebAudio wrapper.
