# info

I am a visual artist and programmer based in Brooklyn, NY. I enjoy building, using, and thinking about playful tools. 

Since 2021, I've been working at [Bitsbox-https://bitsbox.com], where I code and design 3D worlds for the web. Before that, I taught graphic design and 3D animation at the Shintaro Akatsu School of Design in Connecticut. 

In my spare time I make ambient video games as a member of [Rustforms-https://rustforms.net], a collective that I co-run with friends. I also love drawing, cycling, and sci-fi.
