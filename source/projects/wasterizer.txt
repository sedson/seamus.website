The Wasterizer (WASM Rasterizer) is an expirement to scratch a few personal itches and answer some questions for myself.

ol
- What is the GPU actually doing when it assembled ans rasterizes triangles between the vertex and fragment stages of the pipeline?
- How does the regular old JavaScript runtime share memory and pass data to the boxed-off chunks of WASM linear memory?
- What does it feel like to write Rust code for something a little bigger than a tiny project?
